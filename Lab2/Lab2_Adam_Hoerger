###About me
![](C:\Users\afhoe\School\STAT 2600\Lab_2\Picofme.jpg)

* I'm interested in econ and my father works for a gold mining company, so I would be interested in seeing what, if any, relationship exists between the price of gold and the state of economies and markets in the world, which I feel could be revealed through use of data analysis.
* Six months from graduation, I would like to be working on some form of software development. For example I'd love to work for Google at some point. I feel that programming in industry will be very different than programming in coursework, and as a result getting to learn these differences soon after college should be very helpful. Further down the line, in maybe 5 years, I would like to be writing programs for investment firms, as in the long-term I would love to be applying computer science to other fields I find interesting (such as finance).
* I hope my greatest career accomplishment is making it to some company on Wall Street.
* In this course, I hope to learn about R as a programming language as well as a tool to get started learning more about data analysis.
* Fun fact, I've played the flute for 7 years.
