1. At least one (non-statistics) question you would like to know the answer to that could be answered by analyzing data

I would like to be able to be able to see general trends of the stock markets and act accordingly on what to trade and buy. 

2. What you would love to be doing six months after graduation and then five years after that (what would make you excited to be doing?)

Six months after graduation, I would love to not live with my parents and be employed in some sort of stem field(hopefully having to do with statistics!).
Five years after graduation, I would love to maybe buy a house in a city or else upgrade to a better apartment with some sort of pet. I would like to be on to not be in an entry level job at this time.

3. What you hope your greatest career accomplishment will be and given these hopes and goals, what you are hoping to learn/accomplish/do in this course

I want to be the best in my field and be a recipient to some field-related awards. 
In this class, I want to become proficent in R enough to analyze and make inferences from data. 

4. You must also include something of your own choosing not described above. Anything. Be creative!

Breakfast food is my favorite type of food. I am a master of making gluten free pancakes in a variety of flavors includding carrot cake pancakes with a cream cheese frosting drizzle. I am eager to come up with some other types of pancake recipes so maybe when i am old and retired, I can open a small breakfast joint.
